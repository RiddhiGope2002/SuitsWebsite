        <p>Pearson Specter Litt LLC (also known as PSL) was a major law firm headquartered in New York, formed after Louis Litt used Mike Ross' secret to leverage himself as a name partner. The name partners other than Louis were Jessica Pearson and Harvey Specter. Despite the name change, many clients, opponents and even employees themselves continued to refer to the firm as Pearson Specter.</p>

            <p>  Following Mike Ross' guilty plea, nearly all the employees left the firm, leaving just Jessica, Harvey, Louis, Donna Paulsen, Rachel Zane, Gretchen Bodinski and Benjamin. Shortly after saving a man from death row, Jessica realized that she had forgotten why she became a lawyer in the first place and decides to step down, leaving the firm to Harvey and Louis.</p>
            
                <p> Harvey then assumes the position of managing partner and rehires Mike while promoting Donna from executive assistant to senior partner, although he is made to realize that partnership is a title that should not be given to non-lawyers and instead makes her the firm's new COO. Following Jessica's departure, the firm kept its name for a while before dissolving and restructuring as Specter Litt.</p>

      <h2>Jessica Pearson</h2>
    <p>Jessica Lourdes Pearson, J.D. is the former managing partner of Pearson Specter Litt and current aide to the mayor of Chicago. She began to her legal career after being hired by Charles Van Dyke, one of the three name partners at Gordon Schmidt Van Dyke, due to the fact that she was black and female and the firm wished to fulfill a diversity quota. She made her way up the firm's ranks and, after becoming a senior partner, conspired with Daniel Hardman to oust the three partners and restructure the firm as Pearson Hardman, with Hardman taking over the reins as managing partner.

      However, when Jessica discovered that Hardman was stealing money from the firm and its clients in order to fund an extramarital affair, Jessica and her associate Harvey Specter blackmailed him into resigning from the firm, with the public story being that Hardman stepped down of his volition to take care of his wife, who had cancer. Jessica then became the firm's new managing partner and Harvey was promoted to junior partner, and the firm flourished.

Typically, ENTJs live in a world of possibilities and they are able to imagine future scenarios of how a situation might play out.

    <h2>Louis Litt</h2>
    <p>Louis Marlowe Litt, M.B.A., J.D., Esq. is a corporate attorney and the managing and name partner of Litt Wheeler Williams Bennett. He was promoted to the position of senior partner at Pearson Hardman by Daniel Hardman prior to the latter's second dismissal from the firm, and was also the quartermaster of Pearson Darby.

      Louis initially resigned from Pearson Specter to prevent Jessica Pearson or Harvey Specter from firing him after he embezzled money for Charles Forstman, but after discovering that Mike Ross was a fraud and that the others covered it up, he used that information to blackmail Jessica into making him a name partner, thus forming Pearson Specter Litt.</p>

      He was hired by Harvey Specter, a senior partner at Pearson Hardman, as an associate lawyer, despite Mike not having graduated college or having a law degree. Mike left Pearson Specter after accepting the job offer to work at SIG; however, he returns later in season 4 after Jonathan Sidwell fired him from his firm. Shortly after his return, Louis Litt discovered his fraud and leveraged it to become name partner, forming Pearson Specter Litt. After Jack Soloff and the other partners at PSL acknowledge Mike's worth to the firm, he is promoted from junior associate to junior partner.</p>

      <p>Rachel is good at what she does because she's a competent lawyer, but also because she has a strict moral code and unwavering loyalty to her firm and colleagues. She's always been there for anyone who needed assistance in a work-related matter or with a personal problem. ESFJs are often called the Provider personality specifically because of their genuine desire to do good and help others.
